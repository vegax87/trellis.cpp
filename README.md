# trellis.cpp

A standalone, **GGML-based C++** implementation of Microsoft's
[TRELLIS.2-4B](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/TRELLIS.2-4B) image-to-3D pipeline:
background removal, image conditioning, the three flow transformers, the VAE decoders,
mesh extraction and UV-textured GLB export — all in native C++/GGML with no Python at
runtime. Optionally driven end-to-end from a text prompt with
[stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) producing the
input image.

It ports the reference implementation at
[microsoft/TRELLIS.2](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS.2).

```
./build/trellis-cli assets/goblin.png out/goblin.glb      # image -> UV-textured GLB (atlas + PBR)
python tools/render_glb.py out/goblin.glb out/view.png    # quick multi-view render
```

Prebuilt binaries for Linux and Windows (Vulkan, ROCm, CUDA) are published on the
[releases page](../../releases). Serves as the `trellis` backend of
[Lemonade](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade).

## Quick start

New here? **Trellis Studio** is a one-command install that auto-detects your GPU
runtime (CUDA / ROCm / Vulkan), downloads the server + weights, and gives you a
drag-an-image → 3D desktop app with an interactive preview and a saved gallery.

```bash
# Linux (x86-64)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pwilkin/trellis.cpp/main/install/install.sh | bash
```
```powershell
# Windows (x64), in PowerShell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pwilkin/trellis.cpp/main/install/install.ps1 | iex
```

See [**Trellis Studio (desktop app)**](#trellis-studio-desktop-app) below for what it
does and how to use it, or [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) for the
full walkthrough and installer options.

## Showcase

Seven image→3D reconstructions produced end-to-end by trellis.cpp **v0.4.3** on a
single Radeon 8060S (all res-1024 cascade, seed 42, ~300K faces, 2048² atlas; the
GLBs and their Z-Image-Turbo source images live in
[`assets/showcase/`](assets/showcase/)):

</p>

Each grid is a 4096×4096 four-view capture — front / right / back / left at 75°
elevation, 2048² per view — made with
[`tools/mv_preview/render_quad.js`](tools/mv_preview/render_quad.js), a headless
Playwright driver around Google's `<model-viewer>`: it serves
`tools/mv_preview/quad.html`, loads the GLB into a 2×2 grid of viewers, waits for
auto-framing to settle, captures each view via `toBlob`, and
[`stitch_quad.py`](tools/mv_preview/stitch_quad.py) assembles the final grid.

## Trellis Studio (desktop app)

**Trellis Studio** is the standalone desktop app (built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app))
for anyone who wants image→3D without touching the command line. The one-command
installer above auto-detects your GPU runtime, downloads the matching
`trellis-server` build plus the ~16.5 GB of weights, and installs the app; on launch
it starts and supervises the server for you, so the whole flow is drag-image →
click → rotate the result.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/trellis-studio.png" width="92%" alt="Trellis Studio — drop an image, generate a textured 3D model, preview it interactively">
</p>

**Using it:**

1. **Add an image** — drag-and-drop onto the drop zone, click to browse, or paste
   from the clipboard.
2. **Set options** (optional) — resolution (512 light / 1024 cascade / 1536 high),
   seed, background removal (auto / birefnet / threshold), and UV unwrap
   (xatlas / box). Defaults match the CLI.
3. **Generate 3D** — this takes a few minutes; a live stage line shows progress.
4. **Inspect** — rotate and zoom in the interactive preview (Google's three.js-based
   `<model-viewer>`); **Reset view** re-frames the camera and **Save GLB…** exports
   the model.
5. **Reuse** — every result is kept in a local **gallery** (IndexedDB): click a
   thumbnail to reload its model, input image, and settings — even after restarting
   the app.

The **Settings** panel (gear icon) points the app at a different models directory,
GPU index, or port; the models directory, backend, and server binary come from the
`config.json` the installer writes. Because the UI is a plain web bundle you can also
skip the app entirely and open it in a browser against a `trellis-server` you started
yourself — see [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) for that, the full
installer options, and troubleshooting. The app source lives in [`app/`](app/).

The sections below document the **CLI and HTTP server** directly, for advanced and
scripted use.

## Usage

The default is the **1024 cascade** (LR `flow_512` → upsample → HR `flow_1024` →
res-1024 decode, sharper geometry); `--res 512` selects the lighter res-512 path.
All behavior is driven by CLI flags — run `trellis-cli --help` for the full list.
The most useful ones:

| flag | effect |
|------|--------|
| `--res 512\|1024\|1536` | geometry resolution (512 = light path, no cascade) |
| `--bg-removal threshold\|birefnet` | default **auto**: pre-matted images keep their alpha, otherwise the BiRefNet matte (~13s on GPU). The plain white-bg keyer cuts specular highlights out of the alpha — the flow then generates holes there — so it is opt-in only |
| `--no-texture` | geometry only |
| `--decim GRID` | legacy cluster-grid decimation (default: quadric simplify to 300K faces @1024 / 150K @512; `0` = keep the full-res mesh) |
| `--atlas PX` | UV atlas size (default 2048 @1024 / 1024 @512) |
| `--box-uv` | voxel-native 6-way box projection instead of the default xatlas unwrap (O(faces), faster, looser packing) |
| `--seed N` | RNG seed |
| `--model trellis\|pixal3d` | which family of flow weights `--models` holds (see [Pixal3D backend](docs/pixal3d/README.md)) |
| `--require-gpu` | fail instead of falling back to the (very slow, RAM-hungry) CPU path |

### Pixal3D

`--model pixal3d` runs [TencentARC/Pixal3D](https://github.com/TencentARC/Pixal3D) on the
same engine. Pixal3D is a TRELLIS.2 fine-tune that replaces cross-attention over the DINOv3
patch tokens with **pixel-aligned projection conditioning**: each DiT token is a grid cell,
projected into the image and sampled there. The samplers, decoders, remesh and bake are
shared, so the integration is a conditioning module plus one branch inside the DiT block.
The shape/texture stages also run the NAF guided feature upsampler, ported in
`src/naf.cpp`. See **[docs/pixal3d/README.md](docs/pixal3d/README.md)** for the model set,
the `--fov` camera flag (MoGe-2 estimation is not ported) and the known gaps.

The postprocess matches the reference pipeline op for op (see
`docs/spec/27-reference-postprocess.md` / `28-divergence-matrix.md`): the raw
dual-grid mesh is welded and hole-filled, **remeshed with narrow-band UDF dual
contouring** into a single clean manifold, quadric-simplified to the face budget,
coarse-clustered with the reference's bottom-up normal-cone merge, unwrapped with
stock xatlas per cluster and packed at auto resolution (UVs normalized to fill the
full atlas), shaded per texel by trilinear sampling of the voxel PBR volume (with
BVH closest-point snap onto the original surface), gutter-filled with a Telea
inpaint port, and exported as a GLB with smooth normals and **lossy-WebP textures**
(`EXT_texture_webp`; PNG fallback when built with `-DTRELLIS_WEBP=OFF`). Output
quality is at parity with the reference CUDA postprocess on identical inputs.

`TRELLIS_DBG_*` environment variables toggle developer debug logging only; no
behavior-driving environment variables remain — use the flags above.

### trellis-server

`trellis-server` keeps the process resident (no Vulkan re-init per request) and exposes:

```
GET  /health     -> "ok"
POST /generate      multipart/form-data with an "image" file part; optional text
                    fields "seed", "resolution" (512/1024/1536), "bg_removal"
                    (threshold|birefnet). Returns model/gltf-binary.
```

Launch-time flags (including `--res`) set the per-request defaults; each request can
override them with its own fields.

UV-textured GLB (WebP PBR textures)
```

The decimation is a faithful port of the reference's CuMesh QEM edge-collapse simplifier
(Garland-Heckbert quadrics + a skinny-triangle shape metric + flip rejection + boundary
weighting), replacing an off-the-shelf simplifier that produced a fragmented, non-adaptive
mesh. The result matches the reference's adaptive triangulation — a single watertight
component with reference-level surface smoothness. It runs on the GPU (CUDA, ROCm/HIP, or a
Vulkan compute shader) behind one dispatch, with an automatic CPU fallback.

All three flow stages use a `FlowEulerGuidanceIntervalSampler` (rectified-flow Euler,
12 steps, classifier-free guidance with a guidance interval + rescale). Optional
512→1024 cascade for higher resolution.

The 1024 cascade runs on a 16 GB card thanks to **FlashAttention with padded K/V**
(`src/dit.cpp::sdpa`): the manual softmax needed a single ~18 GB score-matrix alloc at
the sparse-structure stage, and at the HR token count (≈53k) ggml's tiled FA NaN'd on
the unpadded last key-tile — zero-padding K/V to a 256 multiple + BF16 fixes both.
f16 compute is the default and matches torch (`--f32` forces f32; `--no-fa` restores
the plain-softmax path for A/B testing).

Every neural component is validated against PyTorch (the `trellis-test-*` binaries +
`tools/ref_*.py`): SS sampler matches torch to rel 4.3e-3 (exact voxel match), DiT
2.8e-3, DINOv3 1.8e-2, sparse conv 1e-3, BiRefNet 4e-4, C2S exact.

## Models

**Pre-built GGUFs:** [`ilintar/trellis2-gguf`](https://huggingface.co/ilintar/trellis2-gguf) —
download the full set and point `trellis-cli` / `trellis-server` (`--models DIR`) at that
folder. Or convert your own from the source checkpoints below (see `docs/spec/` and
`tools/` for the safetensors→GGUF conversion).

| role | source | notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| SS flow DiT | `microsoft/TRELLIS.2-4B` `ss_flow_img_dit_1_3B_64` | 1.3B, bf16 |
| Shape SLAT flow | `…/slat_flow_img2shape_dit_1_3B_{512,1024}` | 1.3B, bf16; `_1024` drives the cascade's HR pass |
| Tex SLAT flow | `…/slat_flow_imgshape2tex_dit_1_3B_{512,1024}` | 1.3B, bf16; `_1024` drives the cascade's HR pass |
| Shape decoder | `…/shape_dec_next_dc_f16c32` | FlexiDualGrid VAE |
| Tex decoder | `…/tex_dec_next_dc_f16c32` | Sparse U-Net VAE, 6-ch |
| SS decoder | `microsoft/TRELLIS-image-large` `ss_dec_conv3d_16l8` | reused from v1 |
| Image cond | `timm/vit_large_patch16_dinov3.lvd1689m` | ungated mirror of DINOv3 ViT-L (same weights) |
| BG removal | `ZhengPeng7/BiRefNet` | ungated BiRefNet (RMBG-2.0 substitute) |

The two helper models are HF-gated upstream; the ungated equivalents above avoid needing
a token.

## Performance

Measured end-to-end (image → GLB, res 1024, 12-step flows, includes model load;
`docs/spec/29-perf-profile.md` has the per-flow breakdown and methodology):

| input class | Strix Halo iGPU (Vulkan) | RTX 5060 Ti (CUDA) | reference Python, same GPU (cold) |
|---|---|---|---|
| light (goblin, 17k HR tokens) | 6:09 | **3:16** | 3:37 |
| heavy (turret, ~45k HR tokens) | 12:39 | **7:23** | 5:20 |

The postprocess (weld → remesh → decimate → unwrap → bake → WebP) uses the faithful
CuMesh QEM decimation described above. With a GPU backend it decimates a 5.4M→300k-face
mesh in ~5 s on ROCm (gfx1151) — ~18× the single-threaded CPU path — matching the
reference's on-GPU decimation; the CPU fallback stays available for GPU-less builds.
On Strix Halo, Vulkan is the fastest backend: ROCm requires
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1` (ggml's HIP graph capture stalls on these graphs)
and still trails Vulkan by 10–40 %.

## Tools

| tool | purpose |
|------|---------|
| `post-replay <dump.bin> <out.glb>` | re-run the whole postprocess from a `TRELLIS_DUMP_POST` dump in seconds (flags: `--no-remesh`, `--band`, `--no-snap`, `--box-uv`, `--faces`, `--atlas`, …) |
| `tools/glb_metrics.py` | CPU geometry/UV/material metrics (components, boundary edges, winding, texel density, doubleSided/WebP flags) for ours-vs-reference GLB comparison |
| `tools/render_glb.py` / `render_glb_fast.py` | quick multi-view flat renders |
| `tools/mv_preview/` | PBR-correct GLB previews via the `<model-viewer>` web component (see its README) |

## Building

GGML is vendored in `thirdparty/ggml`. Pick a backend:

```
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_VULKAN=ON   # Vulkan
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_CUDA=ON    # CUDA
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_HIP=ON     # ROCm
cmake --build build -j
```

See `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the exact flags the release binaries use
(GPU target lists, `-DGGML_OPENMP=OFF` on Windows). Releases also include a
`cuda12` variant built with CUDA 12.9 for Pascal/Volta GPUs (compute capability
6.0/6.1/7.0); the standalone installers select it automatically for devices such
as the Tesla P100.

## Layout

```
src/            C++ implementation (models, ops, pipeline, drivers)
src/test_*.cpp  parity / unit tests vs reference tensors (built as the trellis-test-* binaries)
include/        public headers
tools/          python conversion scripts (safetensors → GGUF) + reference-dump checks, via the uv venv
docs/spec/      reverse-engineered per-component architecture spec
thirdparty/     vendored ggml (gitignored), plus stb + xatlas
```
